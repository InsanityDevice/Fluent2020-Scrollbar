# Outscroll
A customizable scrollbar for chromium browsers. It was inspired by the updated web version of Outlook that came out in 2019.

This scrollbar is available either [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsanityDevice/Outscroll-Scrollbar/master/Outscroll.user.css) or on [UserStyles](https://userstyles.org/styles/179601/outscroll-scrollbar). You can install it using the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) app, available on the Chrome Web Store.

### Limitations
Works with CHROME, OPERA, BRAVE and the new EDGE (any chromium-based browser that allows a userstyles or usercss extension).

Be aware that the scrollbar will sometimes show if the HTML code asks for it, regardless of further CSS/JS code that asks for it to be hidden. There's no way around it with CSS alone. If you don't think it's still worth it, this scrollbar is not for you.

DOESN'T WORK WITH FIREFOX!
And there's nothing I can do about that. Look elsewhere. Github and the FirefoxCSS Reddit are good places to start. Or you could also check out my own Firefox CSS repo while you're here (it's not very tidy, though).
